Flower Display Ideas
1. Growth states
Seedling → Bud → Blooming → Full bloom
Visual progression tied to streak days (e.g., 0–3: seedling, 4–7: bud, 8–14: blooming, 15+: full bloom)
Subtle animations: gentle sway, petals opening, sparkles on milestones
2. Emotional states
Happy: bright colors, slight bounce
Needs care: slight droop, muted colors
Thriving: vibrant colors, glow effect
Based on completion status (both partners completed = happy)
3. Display enhancements
Soft shadow/glow behind the flower
Particle effects (petals, sparkles) on milestones
Subtle parallax on scroll/tilt
Day/night cycle (time-based lighting)
4. Interactive elements
Tap to see care history
Long press for flower details
Swipe to see previous days’ states
Flower Design Recommendations
Art style
Pixel art: consistent with current look, nostalgic, scalable
Hand-drawn: warm, personal
Minimalist vector: clean, modern
Hybrid: pixel art base with subtle gradients/shadows
Design system
Color palette
Each flower type has a distinct color scheme
Seasonal themes (spring pastels, summer brights, autumn warm, winter cool)
Unlockable rare variants (golden, rainbow, etc.)
Flower variety
Common: rose, daisy, tulip, sunflower, lavender
Seasonal: cherry blossom, poinsettia, autumn maple
Rare: lotus, orchid, peony
Special: heart-shaped, star-shaped, custom couple flowers
Progression design
Start small and simple
Add petals, leaves, and details as it grows
Final form: full bloom with unique characteristics
Each flower type has 4–5 growth stages
Technical considerations
Asset sizes: 200x200 base, @2x and @3x variants
Format: PNG with transparency for pixel art, SVG for vector
Animation: frame-based for pixel art, or programmatic for vector
File naming: flower_[type]_[stage]_[state].png (e.g., flower_rose_blooming_happy.png)
Design tools
Pixel art: Aseprite, Piskel, or Procreate
Vector: Figma, Adobe Illustrator
Animation: Lottie (for vector), sprite sheets (for pixel)
Implementation suggestions
Flower model enhancement
Add growthStage (seedling, bud, blooming, full)
Add emotionalState (happy, needsCare, thriving)
Add daysAlive to track growth
Visual feedback
Color overlay based on state
Scale transform for growth stages
Opacity/glow effects for emotional state
Garden view
Grid layout showing all collected flowers
Each flower shows its current state
Tap to see full details and care history
Should I implement any of these? I can:
Add growth stages to the Flower model
Create a flower state system
Add visual effects/animations
Design the garden view layout
